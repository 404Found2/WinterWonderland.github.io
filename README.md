## Inspiration and What It Does
Wanting to do a little more than just create a website on Christmas, this website was made to include a little more than just information! We have a selection of fun Holiday themed games to get you in the spirit, as well as opportunities to give back to the community during this festive season!

## How we built it
Winter Wonderland was built using HTML(to build layout), CSS(to style elements), and Javascript(for interactivity)!

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into:
- Working out the animations. This was my second time working with scroll based animations, so it took a while to get used to creating these animations (especially the timeline one). Making the timeline ending dynamic (for any screen height and width) was difficult
- Programming the games from scratch! It took a while to get all the visual aspects perfect to create a fun User Experience!
- Creating the search and filters and making the html webpage more dynamic. All the different activities are filtered dynamically.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The Countdown Timer
- The Selection of Games in the Games Section (How many of the Trivia Questions can you get right?) â€“especially the Wordle
- The Animations (My favorite is the Timeline one!)
- The search and filter bars in the Activities page (How many activities have you tried?)
- Creating a favicon, this was the first time I was doing it!

## What we learned
I learned to synthesize my code so it is as efficient!
For example I learned to do this:  
`.parent:hover .child {
	/*changes that need to be made */
}
`

Versus creating an eventListener for the parent element to change the child.

## What's next for Winterland!
Why stop at one game when you can have more? Winter Wonderland is hoping to be able to add more games to this website! Currently a Winter themed memory game is in the works, but I would love to hear any suggestions you may have on holiday related games.
