            <div class="subTime">Saturnalia: The First Christmas</div>
            <div class="des">In Rome, where winters were not as harsh as those in the far north, Saturnalia—a holiday in
                honor of Saturn, the god of agriculture—was celebrated. Beginning in the week leading up to the winter
                solstice and continuing for a full month, Saturnalia was a hedonistic time, when food and drink were
                plentiful and the normal Roman social order was turned upside down. For a month, enslaved people were
                given temporary freedom and treated as equals. Business and schools were closed so that everyone could
                participate in the holiday's festivities.<br><br> Also around the time of the winter solstice, Romans
                observed Juvenalia, a feast honoring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper classes
                often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was
                believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithra’s birthday was the most
                sacred day of the year.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <div class="time">6th Century</div>
            <div class="subTime">The Christian Christmas</div>
            <div class="des">In the early years of Christianity, Easter was the main holiday; the birth of Jesus was not
                celebrated. In the fourth century, church officials decided to institute the birth of Jesus as a
                holiday. Unfortunately, the Bible does not mention date for his birth (a fact Puritans later pointed out
                in order to deny the legitimacy of the celebration). <br><br> Pope Julius I chose December 25. It is
                commonly believed that the church chose this date in an effort to adopt and absorb the traditions of the
                pagan Saturnalia festival. First called the Feast of the Nativity, the custom spread to Egypt by 432 and
                to England by the end of the sixth century. <br><br> On Christmas, believers attended church, then
                celebrated raucously in a drunken, carnival-like atmosphere similar to today’s Mardi Gras. Each year,
                the poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to
                comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. Christmas became the time of year
                when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined “debt” to society by entertaining less
                fortunate citizens.

            <div class="subTime">The Cancellation of Christmas</div>
            <div class="des">In the early 17th century, a wave of religious reform changed the way Christmas was
                celebrated in Europe. When Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan forces took over England in 1645, they vowed
                to rid England of decadence and, as part of their effort, cancelled Christmas. By popular demand,
                Charles II was restored to the throne and, with him, came the return of the popular holiday. <br><br>The
                pilgrims, English separatists that came to America in 1620, were even more orthodox in their Puritan
                beliefs than Cromwell. As a result, Christmas was not a holiday in early America. From 1659 to 1681, the
                celebration of Christmas was actually outlawed in Boston. Anyone exhibiting the Christmas spirit was
                fined five shillings.</div>

        <div class="text">
            <div class="time">19th Century</div>
            <div class="subTime">Reinventing the Holiday</div>
            <div class="des">The early 19th century was a period of class conflict and turmoil. During this time,
                unemployment was high and gang rioting by the disenchanted classes often occurred during the Christmas
                season. In 1828, the New York city council instituted the city’s first police force in response to a
                Christmas riot. This catalyzed certain members of the upper classes to begin to change the way Christmas
                was celebrated in America. <br><br> In 1819, best-selling author Washington Irving wrote The Sketchbook
                of Geoffrey Crayon, gent., a series of stories about the celebration of Christmas in an English manor
                house. In Irving’s mind, Christmas should be a peaceful, warm-hearted holiday bringing groups together
                across lines of wealth or social status.Irving’s book, however, was not based on any holiday celebration
                he had attended—in fact, many historians say that Irving’s account actually “invented” tradition by
                implying that it described the true customs of the season.</div>

            <div class="subTime">Christmas Presents Arrive</div>
            <div class="des">The family was also becoming less disciplined and more sensitive to the emotional needs of
                children during the early 1800s. Christmas provided families with a day when they could lavish
                attention-and gifts-on their children without appearing to “spoil” them.<br><br>As Americans began to
                embrace Christmas as a perfect family holiday, old customs were unearthed. People looked toward recent
                immigrants and Catholic and Episcopalian churches to see how the day should be celebrated. In the next
                100 years, Americans built a Christmas tradition all their own that included pieces of many other
                customs, including decorating trees, sending holiday cards and gift-giving.</div>

            <div class="time">19th Century</div>
            <div class="subTime">Santa Claus Comes to Town!</div>
            <div class="des">The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back to a monk named St. Nicholas who was born in
                Turkey around A. D. 280. St. Nicholas gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside
                helping the poor and sick, becoming known as the protector of children and sailors.<br><br>St. Nicholas
                first entered American popular culture in the late 18th century in New York, when Dutch families
                gathered to honor the anniversary of the death of “Sint Nikolaas” (Dutch for Saint Nicholas), or “Sinter
                Klaas” for short. “Santa Claus” draws his name from this abbreviation. <br><br>The iconic version of
                Santa Claus as a jolly man in red with a white beard and a sack of toys was immortalized in 1881, when
                political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore's poem to create the image of Old Saint Nick we know
                today.</div>

                something for everyone! In fact, so many people celebrate the holiday that there are about 15,000
                Christmas tree farms in the United States, and trees usually grow for between four and 15 years before
                they are sold.
